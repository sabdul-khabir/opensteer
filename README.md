# OpenSteer

Steering Behaviors for Autonomous Characters 

## Description

OpenSteer is a C++ library to help build steering behaviors for autonomous characters in games and animation. OpenSteer provides an app which displays predefined demos of steering behaviors. You can prototype, visualize and debug your own as a plug-in.

## This Fork

This repo contains a fork([revision 190](https://sourceforge.net/p/opensteer/code/190/)) of the OpenSteer project. You can learn more about OpenSteer at [https://opensteer.sourceforge.net/](https://opensteer.sourceforge.net/).

## Changes From r190

The purpose of this fork was to completely separate the OpenSteer library from the demo program. The 'src' directory now only contains library source files and the 'demo' folder only contains source for the demo program.

## Other Changes

- Adds an on-screen command key list for the demo program.
- Removes the demo program source code from the library's namespace.
- Refactors glut code into their own files.
